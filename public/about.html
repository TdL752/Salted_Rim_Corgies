				American Kennel Club

			<p class="text">
				The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a non-profit organization that stands for animal ethics. 
				Founded in 1884 the AKC has created a set of standards for all purebred breeds that showcase the dogs strengths and health. 
				Although AKC registration is not a requirement for dogs unless they plan to compete in shows or animal sports, we still maintain and achieve the AKC standard for the health of the breed.

				All of our dogs are certified as being purebred welsh corgis for the benefit of the animal. 
				Purebred animals are less prone to medical conditions or complications, and when bred to the AKC standard, are given the best quality of life.

				Traits
			</h1>
			<p class="text">
				Corgis are known for being very energetic due to their instinct to herd animals, you may even notice your animal instinctively trying to herd other animals. 
				This energetic nature means that corgis need extra mental stimulation; without toys and sufficient play they may get into trouble, utilizing their high intelligence to find the mental stimulation they need. 
				Corgis are also known for being very loyal and affectionate pets, they love attention and hands on play. 
				The AKC describes corgis as being good with other dogs and young children which our puppies will be exposed and conditioned to. 
				Allergies should be considered closely, although they are not a long hair breed they do shed and blow their coats with changing weather, some extra care in grooming may be necessary. 
				Corgis can be very protective and vigilant while also being prepared to meet new friends, with the right exposure corgis love meeting new people and pets. 
				When it comes to training they are considered pretty easy and fast learners, we almost never get complaints about temperament or social issues.
